### Introductions & DS roles
- DS: Teaching specialist, CMSE. Starting B
- AK: CMSE Asst. Prof. Gaps missteps
- YZ: SSDA director. Offer introductory and advanced/intermediate workshops in R & Python (data mining, visualization), social exchange, seminars. Next Monday: Intro to Python.
- JR: R-Ladies
- CA: R-Ladies, Data Science club initiative, collaborative grants. REU and international experience for grad students.
- JB: Academic and Research Technology; IT Services; Address reserach and technology needs on campus by other departments/colleges. How to understand the gaps and needs to help these researchers
- MH: Director of CSTAT; R tutorials starting next week (Friday evening after 530p). Want to offer every semester. Starting R helpdesk (students/faculty/postdocs/researchers) this Thursday. Work with multiple units together.
- SS: DS user. Have computational biology problems. Training grant: NRT IMPACTS.
- DB: Runs the data science team at ADS (within ITS). Service organization. Data governance. Cloud computing. Data warehousing. Initial consulting is free. Prototyping could be free. Actual projects are paid.

- Data Science seminar series every Friday by CMSE (quantum computing)?

### Discuss potential DS learning community directions
_What activities, topics would get us to the common DS learning/teaching goals._
- Experiences that co-curricular groups could work on together
- What people have been doing successfully & how can we design similar programs for smaller/wider communities
- Collaborative research/training grants together?
- Academic technologies - what are people using? vetting them for costs, licenses, security, and accessibility. e.g., RStudio instances.
- Catalog of services -- what students need, what are the different units doing? how to reduce redundancy?
- Lots of introductory workshops around the campus -- may be OK but how to coordinate?
- Synergise training -- how do researchers view DS and get them up to speed (with machine learning or other concepts that are important) -- esp. faculty and experienced researchers.
- Can we have coordinated themes across units? and organize workshops accordingly? pool resources?
- Invite experienced DS to give seminars.
- Compulsory quantitative sciences course for College of Natural Science

## Future Directions
- Identify themes and next steps
- What do we need to be actively working on? Different topics for different sub-groups?
